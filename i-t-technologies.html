                Cloud computing is a universal paradigm for computing
                infrastructure and solutions delivered as a service. Cloud
                computing eliminates the need to plan, build and maintain
                internal infrastructure for businesses because it is
                cost-efficient, allowing companies only to pay cloud providers
                for services on an as-needed basis. Cloud computing works by
                implementing virtualization - allowing just one physical machine
                to host many different servers by creating multiple virtual
                machines. These servers do not interact, and all files and
                applications are not visible or accessible to each other despite
                all being on one physical device. By utilising virtual machines,
                data centres can use their physical space more efficiently -
                allowing one data centre to become many, also reducing
                electricity and maintenance costs.

                There are three leading service modules for cloud computing
                which are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a
                Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS is a
                distribution model where a cloud provider delivers virtualized
                compute, network, and storage resources to businesses on demand.
                Companies can scale the resources they pay for on an as-needed
                basis. The most commonly used examples of this are Amazon Web
                Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine
                (GCE). PaaS is a distribution model where a cloud provider hosts
                infrastructure like IaaS and includes development tools and
                database management systems. PaaS allows developers a platform
                to create without installing additional software or buying
                expensive hardware. The most commonly used examples of this are
                Google App Engine (GAE), IBM Cloud, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

              <span>
                SaaS, also called cloud-based software, is a distribution model
                where a cloud provider hosts an application&apos;s server,
                database, and code. Users will access the software upon applying
                to a subscription model. The most commonly used examples of this
                are Slack, Dropbox, and Google G Suite. SaaS is today&apos;s
                cutting-edge technology for cloud computing as it is the primary
                way most people outside of businesses will interact with the
                cloud. This is due to requiring customers to purchase no
                hardware or software and not having to maintain any
                applications. The main difference between SaaS and traditional
                software is that SaaS isn&apos;t selling a product; it&apos;s a
                service that will be continually maintained. Users can access
                SaaS applications from anywhere and on any device, allowing for
                greater flexibility in businesses as their employees can operate
                from outside of the workplace. Employees don&apos;t need to
                install software on each device they access or purchase new
                licensing. With the increase of SaaS applications rising, this
                also means that data security and privacy are paramount. There
                are huge security risks, too, as anyone with the correct
                credentials can be granted access, thus requiring better
                identification tools.
              </span>

              <br />
              <span>
                There are growing security developments in cloud computing, such
                as SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM); SSPM assesses a
                company&apos;s security measures and configurations for its SaaS
                portfolio. SSPM provides insights, recommendations, and
                automation tools to help enhance security and decrease risks and
                vulnerabilities. Another development is Extended Detection and
                Response (XDR), which provides a more unified security platform
                to monitor incidents and collect and correlate data. XDR is
                offered out of the box, meaning businesses do not need to
                purchase and manage extra tools. XDR will make it possible to
                detect better and react faster to attacks throughout all layers
                of an IT environment, from the cloud to an unprotected endpoint.
                Artificial intelligence will also increase cloud security and
                efficiency by enabling smoother workflows and the ability to
                automate and manage processes. An IBM study suggests that 65% of
                organisations believe AI is essential to their success. (IBM,
                2016). Cloud technology soon requires advanced system thinking
                due to growing program sizes and complexity. Evolution predicts
                that cloud computing will overtake hardware doing most of the
                work, eventually leading to data getting analysed by machines
                without human intervention. &apos;By 2024, more than 45% of IT
                spending on system infrastructure, infrastructure software,
                application software and business process outsourcing will shift
                from traditional solutions to cloud.&apos; (Gartner, 2019 para.
                1).

                As cloud computing advances, businesses will likely adopt a
                multi-cloud/hybrid-cloud approach to improve their security,
                scalability, flexibility, and reliability by diverting their
                workload. This approach has some drawbacks, such as increased
                management complexity, interoperability, latency, and governance
                and compliance concerns. Multi-cloud is when a business uses two
                or more public cloud services in a single network. This approach
                aims to eliminate the reliance on a single cloud provider while
                allowing for increased disaster avoidance by having data and
                compute resources available at all times to avoid downtime.
                Multi-cloud requires employees who have expertise across
                multiple cloud systems, as they aren&apos;t always compatible
                with each other. Multi-cloud can also be a hybrid cloud, as
                hybrid cloud typically refers to a business combining an onsite
                data centre or a private cloud, or both, along with a public
                cloud. Hybrid cloud is generally used in regulated businesses,
                such as banks, government, and healthcare since it requires some
                data stored on-premises. Hybrid cloud offers reduced latency and
                increased performance due to the typical use of an onsite data
                centre. It is also easier for businesses to adopt a cloud
                computing approach by simply adding a public cloud provider
                alongside their existing infrastructure. Multi-cloud and hybrid
                cloud are just strategies to improve how businesses use cloud
                computing. Whichever approach a business decides to take,
                they&apos;re still adopting the future of data storage,
                security, and privacy by jumping into cloud computing.

              <br />
              <span>
                The most significant impact of Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud is
                the increased ability to save money by choosing the lowest
                services for each provider and not be vendor locked; this allows
                businesses to focus more capital on innovative areas. Cloud
                engineers, developers, and architects will also have to become
                experts in more than just one type of cloud structure, as they
                aren&apos;t all compatible. As more businesses adopt multi and
                hybrid clouds, they will typically see less downtime, faster
                innovation, and increased efficiency. While Multi-cloud can make
                internal infrastructure redundant for businesses, hybrid cloud
                does not, as they add to what they already own and maintain.
                Multi and hybrid clouds can potentially impact the jobs of cloud
                experts who don&apos;t adapt to the requirement of knowing
                multiple types of cloud structures; however, as these strategies
                are still in their infancy, there is still plenty of time to
                learn. People learning to become cloud experts are advantaged
                remarkably now as there are many ways to gain certifications and
                the skills cloud computing requires. University isn&apos;t
                always the only approach that one can take.

                My ideal job is to become a database administrator, so
                multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies will affect me. I will
                need more certifications and skills than if a business were not
                to use any cloud computing services. On top of needing SQL
                certifications, I need platform expertise, such as Oracle,
                Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. I potentially utilise multi and
                hybrid cloud with apps such as Dropbox, iCloud, Discord, MS
                Teams, G Suite, and Steam in my daily life. The most common
                cloud service that I use is iCloud, as I use this to store all
                of my University work so I can access it on my Mac and my PC. I
                also use Steam cloud saves, as it’s unnecessary to store on both
                my computer and the cloud. I’ve been using Google Docs to
                collaborate with my group members for our assignments and I’ve
                really enjoyed the real time, working together aspect. I have
                friends who work from home using Amazon WorkSpace, so I&apos;m
                sure that they appreciate their employers being flexible by
                allowing work from home by utilising cloud computing. Cloud
                computing is still developing, and its future is bright. With
                cloud-only PCs, cloud VR/AR headsets, and cloud gaming platforms
                such as Google Stadia and Amazon Luna, most people will start to
                utilise cloud computing in their everyday lives. No matter the
                strategy one of these companies uses, typically, their users
                will not notice a difference aside from decreased downtimes.

            <span>
              Cyber security, or electronic information security, is one of the
              most important aspects of a business to run smoothly and keep data
              safe. Just as people are hired to protect customers at a bar or
              even a prime minister at a conference, those who specialise in
              cyber security are able to set up defences for mobile phones to
              large networks. Before the internet, those who had access to
              technological devices only needed to use passwords to protect
              themselves. It wasn&apos;t until the 70&apos;s that a group of
              researchers began experimenting with computer programs on a
              network called ARPANET, meaning The Advanced Research Projects
              Agency Network. They discovered they could move the network and
              leave a trail to follow wherever the program went. Bob Thomas was
              the head of this task and named the program &apos;CREEPER&apos;,
              which left a message circulating that said &apos;I&apos;M THE
              CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.&apos; Not long after this, a man
              named Ray Tomlinson, who also invented email, designed a program
              that could self-replicate, becoming the first computer worm.
              Thankfully he created another program called Reaper that followed
              the worm and deleted it. This was the first example of antivirus
              software and the beginning of cyber security.

            <span>
              Since then, the risk and amount of &apos;hackers&apos; online have
              also grown and become stronger, leading to cyber security doing
              the same. Instead of only a password to keep your devices and data
              safe, you now have access to programs that do so much more. In
              most cases, viruses can&apos;t be sent around without being seen
              until it is too late. As of right now, there are many avenues to
              achieve a top standard of safety regarding cyber security.
              Antivirus and firewall programs are some of the most popular
              options. With antivirus programs scanning your computer for
              suspicious files and software, then destroying them, implementing
              a firewall program to work alongside that to monitor traffic
              between your network and the internet, your data, and personal
              information will remain safe. Although antivirus software will do
              most of the work, it&apos;s also down to the consumer, as falling
              for a suspicious email with a link can corrupt the smallest of
              devices. With the growing range of devices, more and more data is
              being created, meaning more advancements are needed in cyber
              security.

              Artificial intelligence over the past years has made great strides
              in how and where it can be used. Cyber security is one of them.
              For most work areas, especially those that rely on tasks being
              completed via a technological program or device, AI has been
              implemented to manage better time spent on tasks and money spent
              on employees. This will be a great benefit to have within a
              company, but it also creates another target for hackers. An
              example of this is Cognitive Security.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Cognitive security refers to the application of AI and Machine
              learning technologies to create machine learning algorithms that
              can then detect an upcoming threat before it has done any damage.
              This AI technology can do many tasks simultaneously, whereas a
              person doing the same will have to go down many avenues to reach
              the same result. It will be a huge step forward in the right
              direction but may also lead to fewer job opportunities in this
              sector. As we are moving into the age of technology, many
              companies are now choosing options that involve programs or
              relevant technology to take the place of human employees. This
              would be because AI applications are a faster resource and more
              affordable in the long run. Behavioural analytics is another
              technology that is helping advance the cyber security sector.
              Observing a network or system for an increase in data transmission
              can imply that there may be a security issue. Just as they would
              analyse behaviours on social media accounts to determine which
              advertisements are appropriate, they do the same but search for
              abnormal activity on specific networks. There are also options to
              have embedded hardware authentication to keep the physical aspects
              of your computer and its data safe. Instead of just a single
              password or pin, you now have numerous options to authenticate
              your belongings.

            <span>
              With these new technological advancements in cyber security, I can
              see the risk of unseen dangers reducing. Instead of having a
              professional jump into something to sort through data and the
              potential threats, having an AI application interact immediately
              and eradicate the threat will take less time and in turn make the
              company or user more productive to attend to other tasks.
              Significant events, such as elections, will soon become more
              secure than ever. It&apos;s well known that hackers wait for the
              right moment, usually when an event is taking place, to attack and
              compromise the data used. Instead of having professionals on the
              clock to assess any abnormalities that may arise, the AI
              application will detect the very beginning of an issue and stop it
              before it gets out of hand. Using a feature of this AI application
              called language processing, the professionals involved will be
              able to detect where the cyber-attack has originated from. This
              processing tool will also be able to analyse vulnerabilities
              within a network or system.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              This is suitable for companies, and also, most everyone with a
              technological device will benefit from these advancements. Cyber
              security can be acknowledged as the backbone of many people&apos;s
              lives. Without such a thing, I could imagine those who&apos;ve
              joined the online world would instead leave it, just like you
              would if a store didn&apos;t have security cameras or people to
              protect you. A potential downfall could involve those working in
              this industry being replaced by such programs. These professionals
              are highly sought after, so moving these AI technologies to work
              alongside them may only be a transition. Until this technology can
              work unsupervised, it may be a case of employing someone or a
              group of people to check over and perform maintenance on the
              application.

              As programs and security options grow faster and more reliable,
              this will hugely affect my daily life. Having choices in different
              technologies to protect my separate devices will keep the growing
              amount of data I create safe. As new products are designed, so are
              the security avenues. Antivirus software developed in the early
              2000s might not have the capabilities needed to protect something
              bought in 2022, so knowing the advancements being made and set to
              be made down the track helps ease the stress of potential data
              breaches. At the moment, I&apos;m pretty pleased with where we are
              in terms of keeping our data safe. Having AI detect changes in
              data transmission before it&apos;s happened and if data has been
              compromised will, in turn, leave less work for myself and others
              to do as well as the program to identify and delete any threat. In
              terms of the effect on businesses, having the option to do tasks
              concurrently via an online cloud, the safety measures are only
              being altered in their favour. Like medication to cure an illness,
              cyber security is upping the ante by moving with new threats. As
              Cognitive security is in its infancy, I can only imagine how the
              future will look for Cyber security. It&apos;s taken approximately
              50 years since the creation of antivirus software, and it seems we
              are only getting started.

              Blockchain is a technology that has recently taken the world by
              storm. It can be described as a decentralised digital ledger that
              is immutable and is maintained using a global peer-to-peer
              network. In 1991, blockchain was developed by a group of
              researchers to timestamp digital documents which would prevent
              them from being backdated or tampered with. From 2009 onward, this
              tool was adopted and improved by Satoshi Nakamoto to host the
              world’s first-ever cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

            <br />
            <span>
              Like how much of our technology has been built to date to adapt to
              a need, the blockchain has continuously been adapted and built
              upon to extinguish the need for the financial services offered by
              centralised systems such as governments or banks. Some of the
              reasons for this are the fact that these centralised systems are
              prone to security breaches, tampering and control. One of the main
              reasons for the development of blockchains and cryptocurrencies,
              however, is to replace conventional currency.

              “The core problem with fiat is all the trust that is required to
              make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the
              currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches
              of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and
              transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of
              credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust
              them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves
              drain our accounts.” (Satoshi Nakamoto, 2009, para. 2 )

              An example of a flaw in centralisation is that once upon a time,
              encryption for users’ personal information did not exist. For
              years, people relied on password protection to secure their data
              and trusting that a system administrator would keep their
              information hidden and safe. This person had the opportunity to
              override user privacy and potentially leak, or unwittingly allow
              bad actors to gain access to this information. This is the same
              issue we have with centralised systems in control of our funds.

              A quick and easy-to-understand analogy for blockchain is like a
              Google Doc being used for a university assignment. For multiple
              people to work on the document - rather than transferring it back
              and forth or everyone having their own copy of the document – it
              is distributed, which allows everyone to have access
              simultaneously, and every modification is recorded in real-time
              making edits fully transparent. Before the document is submitted,
              a majority of the group agrees that their submission is adequate
              and then proceeds to upload it. (Builtin.com, n.d.)

              Blockchain is composed of three leading technologies in itself:
              Cryptographic keys, a peer-to-peer network and a means of
              computing. (Simplilearn, 2022) For a user to make a transaction on
              the blockchain, each party will hold public and private keys that
              control the asset they own. Public keys are also known as
              “addresses.” These are a mix of numbers and letters which must be
              shared to receive assets. A private key represents the final
              control and ownership of a wallet. This private key also acts as a
              signature or a pin on your bank card – however, if lost, cannot be
              retrieved.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Proceeding, a request is made by a user by signing with their set
              of private keys to broadcast a transaction across the network
              which is then placed into a pool containing hundreds, if not
              thousands of other transactions. From here, the transactions are
              verified by validators or miners who use computing power to race
              and solve complex math problems to receive a reward in
              cryptocurrency for being the one to successfully “mine” the block
              (crack the code and add their block to the chain). Just in the way
              that we would mine for gold.

              Once the block is added to the chain, a piece of the code (known
              as a hash – like a barcode or signature) from the previous block
              is also embedded. The benefit of this is to make the blockchain
              practically unhackable. If someone were able to hack a block, the
              hash on the new block would not match the previous, thus
              everything from there on would not be valid. Another major
              security feature of the blockchain is that 51% of all devices on
              the network must agree that the block was solved correctly.

              Although the blockchain was originally developed to manage digital
              currencies such as Bitcoin and is the most known use case, it has
              also become widely used for an abundance of applications in
              different industries. Some of these include supply chain
              management, cyber security, healthcare, governments, and other
              financial sectors like banking and Defi (decentralised finance.)
              (P. Baker, 2021). The biggest commonality across all of these
              industries is the fact that they need a secure and immutable means
              of accessing and storing information.

              NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are a massive growing aspect of the
              blockchain, and I believe they have the biggest growth potential
              for real-world use cases. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies,
              which can be traded or exchanged at equivalency, NFTs are assets
              on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that
              distinguish them from each other. Being unique and non-fungible,
              these make the perfect tool for both consumer and commercial
              applications. Currently, in these early days, NFTs are a majority
              of digital artwork, collectibles, avatars, and in-game items.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              ‘As NFTs can have only one owner at a time, this gives the owner
              exclusive rights, and the use of blockchain technology makes it
              simple to verify ownership and transfer the tokens between owners.
              The creator can also store specific information in an NFT’s
              metadata. For instance, artists can sign their artwork by
              including their signature in the file.’ (R. Conti, 2022)
            </span>

            <br />
            <span>
              I can see NFTs having much greater utility in the near future. One
              simplistic yet super-hyped approach to an NFT concept comes from
              the well-known collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). BAYC is a
              collection of 10000 unique NFTs (BAYC, n.d.) that serve as a badge
              or ticket to enter an exclusive social club that hosts events both
              digitally and all over the globe, also providing holders exclusive
              access to. This approach of having a “ticket” could impact our
              daily lives behind the scenes, such as having blockchain
              verifiable concert tickets, plane tickets, awards, digital
              identities, government IDs, digital driving licenses and so much
              more. I believe using NFTs and blockchain will mostly go unseen by
              the everyday person; however, this will be the backbone of how we
              live day-to-day in an ever-growing digital world.

            <span>
              To date, NFTs, in the sense of collectibles, have been a big part
              of my financial well-being. Buying and selling these has greatly
              increased my portfolio. As more utility is added to these pieces
              of technology, the world around us will adapt. We already do not
              have to carry around wallets as there are practically built into
              our devices. The New South Wales government have already
              implemented digital drivers’ licenses that are underpinned by
              blockchain technology (J.Hendry, 2018). The impact blockchain has
              had on our world already has been massive and will further
              continue to grow.

                Machine learning is a form of data and algorithmic iteration
                used to create patterns by imitating learning techniques.
                Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence as it
                simulates human intelligence in the way that repetitive process
                leads to mimicking human decision-making. It ties in with the
                field of data science due to the demand for efficient studies of
                big data, which can be achieved with the use of machine
                learning. Visualising machine learning is said to look like
                layers or a neural network, just like within the brain of a
                living being (see Figure 3). The result of machine learning is
                applying the data that has been learned from repetition to make
                informed decisions.

                The key factors in distinguishing machine learning from other
                branches of artificial intelligence are the repetition of tasks
                to simulate human trial and error, also known as rote learning.
                Differences in trials are encountered and stored for future
                analysis by the program. These variations in results contribute
                toward the program being able to effectively make decisions
                based on expected outcomes.

                There are many approaches to machine learning, such as
                supervised learning, reinforcement learning, dimensionality
                reduction, and deep learning. Deep learning is quickly becoming
                the dominant approach in machine learning studies. Although its
                deeply layered artificial neural network requires continual and
                vast repetition to analyse data in logical pathways, it creates
                a system beyond that of traditional learning subtypes.

                Machine learning is applicable in many fields of research and
                innovation. Notable areas are fraud detection, dynamic pricing
                tactics, market research and customer segmentation, chatbots,
                and support services. One of the largest and key everyday uses
                is within virtual personal assistants, such as the artificial
                intelligence shipped as a core feature in all capable
                smartphones. Machine learning is also becoming more applicable
                within feature-rich video games where artificial intelligence
                must make decisions based on user inputs rather than developers
                writing out hundreds of potential scenarios.

                The current state-of-the-art technology in machine learning
                fields is focused on creating AI to perform tasks so that humans
                don&apos;t have to, and to a degree of accuracy beyond humans.
                Today&apos;s cutting-edge technology is the use of machine
                learning to develop intelligence for self-driving cars. Once
                thought of as a possibility far into the future, the most
                prevalent example of this technology today is Tesla&apos;s
                Autopilot technology. This technology makes use of neural
                networks to analyse raw images and sensor data from around the
                vehicle to make appropriate decisions on steering and
                acceleration. Complex algorithms and deep learning combine to
                ‘output 1000 predictions every timestep,’ and Tesla&apos;s
                Autopilot ‘neural networks involve 48 networks that take 70,000
                GPU hours to learn’ (Tesla Motors, 2022, para. 5). This
                automobile automation comes with the given problematic scenarios
                of the absence of human morality within AI. For example, when
                presented with the dilemma of the car hitting a pedestrian or
                swerving with a chance to hit a group of pedestrians, how does a
                self-driving car make that decision? This is one of the many
                situations that machine learning is hopefully able to solve when
                it comes to even more significant technological advances in the
                future.

                A recent worldwide benefit from machine learning has been its
                use in predicting the spread and evolution of the Covid-19 SARS
                virus. Supervised learning has been used to analyse virus data
                to monitor and estimate potential mutations in the virus, as
                well as community infection patterns.

                A future advancement in machine learning is heading in the
                direction of humanoid robots to perform tasks that are dangerous
                or repetitive. This then paves the way further into the future
                for self-aware robots, as machine learning, theoretically with
                enough power and a vast amount of neural networks, could
                effectively create a brain that can think for itself, just as
                humans do.

                Recent technological advancements helping humanoid robots edge
                closer to the present are not so huge. We are bound by the
                limitations of how fast technology can be upgraded. For example,
                CPU and GPU processing power is getting better every year;
                however, the rate of progress that is being made by companies
                such as Intel and AMD is slowing down. The advancement of this
                technology is, at its core, limited by how small transistors can
                be made to allow chips to run cooler and more efficiently.
                Machine learning and neural networks take colossal advantage of
                CPU and GPU technology to reduce process time, therefore making
                faster progress. When a program takes “over a month to deploy”
                (thenewsstack.com, 2019, para. 1), any decrease in time can be
                hugely advantageous, as to a large company, every day has the
                potential to gain/lose funds.

                AI and self-driving cars/humanoid robots that will come hand in
                hand will undoubtedly have an impact on the world. Once these
                technologies are widely accessible to the majority of people,
                some more complex daily tasks, whether in homes or the
                workplace, will not require a human to perform. Examples are the
                step up to 100% complete self-driving cars, factory automation,
                and household chore robots such as cleaning. People who will
                benefit the most from AI assistance are those who struggle to
                complete tasks themselves, such as the elderly and disabled.
                Taking away the responsibility for carers and the action from
                the users allows for more time to relax/rest.

                AI in the future will replace dangerous and undesirable jobs due
                to the nature of robots not requiring the same level of
                supervision and safety as humans. Obviously, having jobs become
                redundant is undesirable, however, new opportunities will become
                available. Manufacturing of the robots and cars themselves will
                likely be automated also, but there is always a need for
                operators to supervise and manage these facilities. Great minds
                are required for advancement in the technologies that support
                these ideas, such as the creation and upkeep of the neural
                networks that make up the basis of AI.

                Personally, I will benefit from AI as a broad subject as it
                continues to evolve over the next few years. I am currently able
                to take advantage of a minor version of &quot;self-driving
                cars&quot; and the AI that is utilised in them, as one of my
                cars is equipped with a self-parking mode. With the press of a
                button and hands off the steering wheel, the data is collected
                by many sensors around the car, and it judges turning angle and
                distance for when to move forward and back. The technology that
                also goes into the motorbikes that I ride has made enormous
                progress in the last five years, with ABS, DTC, and electronic
                suspension control assisting me to ride my best.

                control of driving and definitely take advantage of any
                automated process that will allow them to make the most of the
                increasing age.

                Quality of life only has positive outcomes with the advancement
                of AI, as is its purpose. The most extensive improvements to be
                made in the area of AI are regarding the efficiency behind the
                coding of AI, as well as the algorithms and types of learning
                used for each project. Machine learning is the core technology
                in the future of AI and is a hugely in-depth field of computing
                with so much complicated information to learn.
