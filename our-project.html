            <span>
              Our motivation for this project comes from a place of passion for
              racing and competitiveness. Surely that lap has got to be the
              fastest anyone has ever seen?! Ol’ mate Mick couldn’t even come
              close to that time on his ol’ 2 stroke from the 60’s! Whether
              you’ve been riding motorbikes since you were young, looking to get
              into it at an older age, or even just enjoy watching the MotoGP on
              the TV, they are an area of interest for anyone. The excitement
              that comes from the thrilling speeds that can be achieved, the
              relaxation experienced on a slow ride through the hills, and the
              edgy stunts performed in bush motocross all bring some kind of
              inclusivity to the table. Acknowledging this broad spectrum of
              riders has allowed us as a group to discover something in the
              sport that each of us can relate to. We as a group, have a wide
              interest in the racing, mechanical, advertising, social and
              leisure aspects. Encouraging people to join the sport in one way
              or another is the binding theme amongst us and pleases all
              personalities of the group. This app will be our attempt to
              deliver our passion for not only motorbikes, but inclusivity of
              anyone and everyone capable.

              This application will have plenty of features ranging from data
              collection and usage to reward systems and profiles for keeping
              users active and interested in using the app. Below is a
              comprehensive overview of each feature and justification.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />

              The core use of this app will centre around the actual movement of
              the phone with the user. When the user begins their session, the
              app will record relevant data until the user stops the recording.
              The user would press a &apos;start recording&apos; button to begin
              this session. The user will be able to configure this option so
              that recording begins immediately. As a default option, recording
              will not begin until 15 seconds have passed. This will give the
              user time to press the button, store the phone, check their
              jacket, gloves and helmet, and leave the pits to reach the track.
              After the app begins recording and tracking telemetry data, it
              would continue doing so until the user stops the bike and presses
              the &apos;stop recording&apos; button or until a condition has
              been reached. Some examples of conditions that would be
              configurable are after a certain number of successful laps around
              a track or a time limit. An average amount of laps and time of the
              session on a recreational ride day would be ~10 laps and ~15
              minutes, and these would be default values.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              As the application requires the tracking of telemetry data
              produced by the bike&apos;s movement, the phone must have some
              attachment to the rider or bike. The simple solution is to store
              the phone in a jacket pocket, preferably with a zipper, to ensure
              the phone does not fall out.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              After the jacket is zipped up, it is secure enough to stay firm
              against the body so as not to flop around. Depending on the
              position of the pocket, it should not hinder rider movement or
              comfort. Consideration of rider movement on the bike must be taken
              into account, as an excessive movement of the rider, such as
              leaning left and right over the bike or moving forward and
              backward adjusting to required body positioning, may affect some
              telemetry data such as lean angle and g-forces. Although these
              differences in readings would be minor, the phone may also be
              mounted on a sticky bracket with a secure phone holder, wherever
              it is safe to install on the bike. This may be situated on the
              bike&apos;s tank, which is the most commonplace, or near the dash
              cluster, so long as the vision of the road or any necessary
              instruments are not impaired.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              As users are required to use gloves when riding on a track, this
              can be an impairment when operating the app. Most android phones
              have an extra sensitivity function for when users wear gloves.
              However, the app will not be allowed to be used when the rider is
              in motion, only when the rider is stopped. Therefore it is a given
              that riders will usually remove gloves to operate phones. Adding
              to the subject of the device used in motion, the application will
              have a &apos;lockout&apos; mode that prevents the app from
              interacting when it detects a speed above 6kph. This speed is set
              to allow the use of the app still whilst walking, as 6kph is the
              average walking speed.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              The application will utilise the phone&apos;s GPS or an external
              Bluetooth GPS to record the user&apos;s location data. The app
              will be able to utilise this GPS data to display where the user is
              and their previous locations on a map.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              This will allow the user&apos;s speed to be determined using
              distance/time maths. The top and average speeds will be calculated
              for each session and each lap. The import and creation of verified
              and custom track maps will be included in the app. These maps will
              have specific points that indicate turns, straights, and specific
              locations key to each track to identify the track itself. As a
              user passes these points, all data collected at that point will be
              logged. Once the finish line point is passed, a new lap will have
              started, and all data in that lap will be recorded as the
              corresponding lap number. This will allow the user to quickly see
              specific lap data without hunting through the whole session data.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Accelerating values can also be calculated by tracking distance,
              speed, and time. This feature will require a higher polling rate
              GPS module to be accurate. The highest and average acceleration
              and deceleration values will be recorded for each lap and session
              and can be seen at any point. Users will look for some vital
              information out of corners and on the main straight. G-force is a
              data value that can be pulled from a phone&apos;s gyroscopic
              sensors at specific points, which users will want when braking and
              accelerating. G-forces will show how much gravitational force is
              on the rider as they make sudden changes in acceleration and when
              cornering.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              As mentioned earlier, a map import and creation feature will be
              included. This will allow the user to pick a track map out of a
              list or search and import the map and included map points.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              This will show the map as an overhead satellite view or map view,
              with set pins indicating specific points of the map, such as the
              start and finish of corners, straights, finish lines and other key
              points of that track.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              The user will be able to drop extra pins where they like, enabling
              data to be recorded as the user passes them and allowing for more
              accurate data values calculated using these points. These now
              custom maps can be uploaded/exported for others to use. After a
              session, this track map will have a visual element that indicates
              where the user was on the track and at what time. Touching any
              part of this overlay will bring up the &apos;lap choice&apos;
              menu, allowing the user to see data about that point on specific
              laps. The overlay will also indicate red for deceleration and
              green for acceleration over the track.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Suppose the user finds a track not included in any verified or
              custom maps. In that case, the user can drop pins over the map to
              create a custom version. This can be uploaded as a custom map or
              submitted for verification as a verified track. For a map or track
              to be verified, it will be assigned to a verification manager who
              will look at two criteria. These criteria are: authentic, meaning
              it does not run on any private properties without consent, and the
              track has on-site medical attention, and notable, meaning multiple
              people had used the track before and rated it highly. Initially,
              verified tracks will be deployed and updated by our team
              regularly. Then, the responsibility will be passed down to
              Verification Managers. A Verification Manager is a manually chosen
              long time user with no negative marks against their account for
              misuse of the app, breaching any disclaimers or breaking the
              app&apos;s terms and conditions.

              As our application will be collecting personal information and
              data from users, we will be adopting a PBD (Privacy by Design)
              approach, which is a strategic process that &apos;embeds good
              privacy practices into the design specifications of
              technologies&apos; (OAIC, n.d, para. 1) or in other words, being
              proactive opposed to reactive. This will comply with the
              Australian Privacy Act 1988. We will be implementing a privacy
              policy for data collection, which will include our registered
              company name, what data is being collected, how it is used and
              where it is stored, the reasons why we are collecting the
              information, how a user can access their personal information or
              ask for a correction or have their data deleted. We will not
              require age limits to use our application outside of the standard
              ratings on Google&apos;s app store as &apos;The Privacy Act sets
              no minimum age at which an individual can make decisions regarding
              his or her personal information.&apos; (para. 4)

              Our application will have a disclaimer that will prompt the user
              to accept every time they open up the application. This disclaimer
              will limit our liability for external and internal misuse of the
              application, bugs and incorrect information. This will state that
              users will use this app at their discretion. It will also limit
              liability for any accident or injury while using the app.
              Furthermore, it will make a statement that all third party links
              and information available within our application are not our
              responsibility. They may contain copyrighted information out of
              our control. Lastly, it will display basic safety instructions
              such as not riding under the influence and using PPE correctly.

              Along with a disclaimer, we will also require the application to
              have terms and conditions which must be accepted upon the user
              signing up. This is to further build on the disclaimer to limit
              liability and set the rules and community guidelines such as
              harassment, abuse and violating a person&apos;s legal rights.
              Included will also make users agree not to violate our
              company&apos;s intellectual property or any third party and not
              publish or post any explicit, unlawful, obscene or defamatory
              material.

              We will be adding a feature that enables users to assign a phone
              number as their emergency contact. Suppose specific parameters are
              met, such as rapid deceleration, massive g-forces, upset
              stability, and GPS location off track. In that case, an emergency
              notification message can be sent. This can have a custom message
              or the default, including the user&apos;s name, location and last
              known top speed and g-force in the few seconds before the
              incident. This feature will be disabled while the user is on a
              verified track because verification criteria are that the track
              has on-site medical attention.

              We aim to make this app as user friendly as possible, so people
              from all backgrounds and experiences will be able to have a fun
              and engaging experience. There will be social interactions within
              the app to achieve this goal, such as allowing the user to sign up
              and create a profile. Upon profile creation, we would like users
              to choose an avatar that closely represents them and then choose a
              vehicle type and model they own.
            </span>

              As our main product is an Android app, it will be distributed via
              the Google Play Store. Users will be able to download a free trial
              version of the app as well as pay to subscribe to the full paid
              version. Payments will be managed via Google Play’s billing
              system. Our research shows that 97% of the apps in the Google Play
              store are free (Ceci, 2022).

              Due to the price sensitivity of Android app users, this is where a
              freemium subscription model will be effective. Users will be able
              to try out the app functionality, create a profile and track 5
              separate track runs. This will allow the user to get a feel for
              the app benefits and ease of use. Once the user reaches the
              maximum number of free tracking sessions they will be prompted to
              upgrade by signing up to a subscription plan. A trial/freemium
              pricing strategy has been shown to be an effective way to boost
              sales of a paid app. App users pay less attention to the app
              review ratings when they have a chance to experience the app for
              themselves. (Liu et al, 2015).

              There is a trend towards app developers shifting from charging a
              one-off fee to a subscription model. Smartphone users in developed
              markets like the US spend on average $33 a month on app
              subscriptions including streaming services (Lovejoy, 2020). After
              doing some research it was decided to launch the app offering
              users upgrading from the trial to the full version an option to
              pay AUD 10.00 per month, and an offer to pay only 8.00 a month (a
              discount of 20%) if the opt for the annual subscription paying AUD
              96.00 per year.

              We plan to have the option for users to customise their profile
              with stats displaying such as their fastest times or top speeds at
              verified tracks. Users will also be able to favourite tracks and
              leave reviews, which can be shown on profile tabs. We will be
              implementing a follow option for users to follow their friends or
              well-known users of our application, with push notifications being
              an opt-in for when someone a user follows is active on the app. We
              will also be implementing an achievements area on user profiles
              that can display trophies earned, such as &apos;fastest time
              overall on a track&apos; and &apos;most completions overall on a
              track.&apos; Badges will also be used, displaying badges like
              &apos;amount of tracks created overall&apos; and &apos;amount of
              tracks completed in a month.&apos; We would like to have a
              currency system for users so that they can buy items to customise
              their profiles. These items would not be obtainable outside our
              in-app currency and will make profiles stand out more. These
              profile items could be borders, gif avatars, props for user
              avatars, or different shaped profile boxes. The idea behind this
              would be for a regular user to see a more invested user profile on
              forum boards or in our &apos;Top Monthly User&apos; write-up and
              want to engage with the app more to obtain these items. Our
              currency, named ‘Traqstarz’ will be earned for accumulative stats
              such as speeds reached and kilometres tracked. There will be
              thresholds in each category where users will gain currency upon
              reaching. Users can post live streams or recorded footage of
              themselves on tracks via Youtube. A reporting feature will ensure
              that users do not post harmful or violent imagery.

              Hosting a discussion board will be an excellent way for our users
              to interact and gain knowledge from each other. The &apos;Top
              Monthly User&apos; section will be focused on one selected user,
              who will be chosen under specific criteria such as most active,
              most completed tracks or most forum interaction for that month.
              Being given this title at least once will unlock a crown icon that
              will be displayed on the user&apos;s profile to show off. We want
              to welcome everyone who has a passion for racing. To help our
              beginner racers, we decided to have a specific section on tips and
              information on how to get started for beginners and a News and
              Articles section. This information could be helpful for everyone.
              We want to include advice on what type of gear and brands to
              invest in, training and courses available to attend in each
              Australian state and vehicle suggestions. We want our app to feel
              like a community where users can learn new things, interact, and
              participate in the recreational activity they enjoy most.

              By incorporating gear recommendations, we will be able to make
              sure everyone involved in our application will have the tools to
              be as safe as possible. As the times change, so do gear standards
              in terms of safety. In Australia, motorcyclists are required to
              wear an approved helmet that adheres to the Australian (AS1698 or
              AS/NZ1698) standard. Not only do these protect from incidents, but
              by having shatterproof visors and goggles, it creates a defence
              from rough weather, insects and stones. Alongside helmet
              recommendations, we will have an up-to-date list and guide of what
              and where to find the safety gear you need.

              as it aligns with the applications needs. Not only does it provide

              gear guides to keep your search short and successful. A specific
              brand that will be recommended as a base for your biking gear
              needs, is Alpinestars. Alpinestars was first established in 1963
              and has become a world-leading manufacturer of high-performance
              motorbike related products. From gloves to boots, what they design
              has been proven to meet not only the safety standards but to also
              look and feel slimline and as ergonomic as possible.

              Regarding sponsors, we will be focusing on tracks themselves. This
              will provide more information on said tracks, as well as give
              those companies the opportunity to reach more of an audience and
              space for more customers. By having these sponsors on board and
              bringing in more people to use their tracks, there is an
              opportunity for the user to find competing challenges to gain more
              trophies and to make more like minded friends.

              opportunity for the user to find competing challenges to gain more
              trophies and to make more like minded friends.

              To help decide on which app store to start off with we compared
              statistics for the two major mobile operating systems, we found
              that in Australia Android has a market share of 40.72% as at March
              2022, while iOS is most popular with a market share of 57.23%. The
              statistics shift dramatically once you analyse the global market
              as a whole. Globally, Android has a market share of 71.7% as at
              March 2022, while iOS has attained a market share of only 27.57%.
              Among developers, the Google Play store is also significantly more
              popular with 3.48 million apps available for download as at the
              first quarter of 2021, compared to just 2.22 million available
              apps available in the Apple App Store (Ceci, 2022).

              Costs are another important factor. Publishing an app on the Apple
              app store requires registration to the Apple Developer Program
              which has a cost of USD 99.00 per year. Publishing an app on the
              Google Play store requires registering for a Google Play Developer
              Account, and this comes with a one-off fee of USD 25.00. This
              makes the Google Play Store a much more cost effective solution
              (Girdhar, 2021).

              The language that this program will be written in is Java, as it
              is simply object oriented and can be easy to understand. As this
              is a first time project, using such a language is ideal.. This
              application will have its beginnings running on Android devices,
              so a language that works well with Android framework is ideal.
              Java is the native coding language for Android applications and is
              supported by Android Studio, however it has a steep learning
              curve..
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              For any reason that Java can not be used, an alternative is
              Python. Kivy is an open source Python library integrating Android
              framework for mobile applications. Kivy allows for codeable button
              interfaces using built in functions, which will be useful for
              building the app interface.
            </span>
            <br />

              Android devices come equipped with internal GPS modules, which are
              great for general maps and location use, however the polling rate
              of these GPS’s are typically 1Hz. This means that the GPS’s unit
              only pings once every second, which is a good balance between
              usefulness and battery usage in normal situations.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              However in high speed circumstances, in 1 second at 250 kph, you
              would travel 70m. That is a huge distance at those speeds and does
              not provide the accuracy required from the GPS. The answer is to
              utilise a 10 Hz GPS module, meaning a ping every 0.1s. These
              modules range from ‘$100AUD’(qStarz, n.d) and upwards, which is a
              justifiable investment for those serious about the sport, although
              the application will still have some degree of accuracy without an
              external GPS. These external GPS’s connect to the phone via
              bluetooth, and will be required to be with the rider/bike during a
              recording session.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              For maps, pins and map points, we would utilise an open-source
              JavaScript library such as Leaflet© which also implements map data
              and satellite imagery using OpenStreetMaps©.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Being able to leverage an open-source platform, this allows for
              not only flexibility in building our platform but also a very cost
              effective strategy without the need to licence maps from providers
              such as Google. Leaflet maintains very lightweight JS code and has
              the majority of the mapping features already built in that we
              would need to use.
            </span>

            <br />
            <span>
              For our news and article section we would use RSS feeds of popular
              motorbike and motorsports and add them to our application. We
              would not be using all of our articles and news from just one site
              and we would make sure to properly link to the original article as
              well as only provide snippets of the articles on our news and
              articles page, meaning when the user wants to read more they have
              to click on an article and will be taken to the original source
              article.

            SKILLS REQUIRED
          </span>
          <span class="our-project-skills-required-text">
            <span>
              To start, the coding skills required for this project would be
              knowledge in the Java or Python language, depending on which is
              chosen to be utilised. Being able to write a program and know how
              to efficiently execute appropriate functions and recover from run
              time errors is key to the success of this project. Another
              requirement is the knowledge of how to pull certain data from the
              android framework, such as the many sensors that will be utilised
              within the android phone.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Understanding of how these sensors work is also highly
              recommended, to be able to confidently use the gyroscopic and
              accelerometer data without problems, and the maths behind them in
              case calculations are required. With the integration of Leaflet,
              we need to learn how to gain access to OpenStreetMaps satellite
              imagery of the tracks that users will be using, as well as
              downloading and importing these to the app. We will need to read
              up on how to use Google Firebase as this is where we will host and
              build our application as Google Firebase offers a free option with
              some capacity and traffic limitations, however we are unlikely to
              reach these limits. Specifically how to properly utilise Google
              Firebases&apos;s database.

              With the success of this project, users will be able to accurately
              track lap times, speed, and acceleration at specific times and
              locations around a track. This data will be able to be reviewed
              after a session, with comparison data available. Detailed data can
              be saved, shared, deleted, and viewed by others. The application
              will include the ability to add and track your friends via a
              profile system which the user can keep updated with an avatar,
              favourite bike, favourite track, and even best times for each
              track. The app can link to helpful videos and schooling for
              beginner riders, as well as current news and articles in the
              racing world. A reward system will be implemented where the user
              can earn trophies for top times or most completions on verified
              tracks, badges for stat tracking such as ‘five tracks completed in
              May’ or ‘two tracks made in May’ and currency for participating in
              events and accumulative stats such as kilometres tracked, speeds
              reached at verified tracks and tracks visited. The currency, which
              we are naming ‘Traqstarz’ can be used to purchase profile
              additions that aren’t available normally. The target audience for
              this application is going to be for those passionate riders who
              can make full use of the app, and those just beginning their
              journey into the world of motorbikes and related events. The use
              of the app will help users to ride their best and experience the
              joy that comes with thrilling speeds and the flow of a racetrack.
