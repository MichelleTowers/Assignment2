                    Group member contributions were split evenly as much as
                    possible; however, we did not stick to this as a strict
                    rule. At some points, we willingly helped each other in
                    small groups working in Google Docs and doing real-time
                    collaboration. We allowed each member to choose parts that
                    they would prefer to work on, helping create a friendly and
                    willing to contribute environment. At first, our group logo
                    was created as a team. This is when we were going ahead with
                    our original project idea and named ourselves &apos;Game
                    Up.&apos; However, Jake, Blayne, and Michelle were up late
                    and talked about our team&apos;s overall lack of
                    contribution to the project idea at that stage, as the group
                    had not yet spoken about how to expand or even create a
                    feasible project.

                  <br />
                  <span>
                    Jake, Blayne, and Michelle then came up with a
                    &apos;proposal of change&apos; to submit to the remaining
                    members of the team. This document was in-depth and spoke
                    about both pros and cons of changing the project idea. The
                    team ended up agreeing with the proposal. We swapped project
                    ideas, had a lengthy discussion about why we hadn&apos;t
                    contributed to the old project idea and concluded that while
                    it was an excellent idea and felt detailed already, not many
                    of us knew how to expand such a business project.

                  <br />
                  <span>
                    With the project idea changed and the announcement of an
                    extension, Blayne, Michelle, and Helia had an impromptu
                    meeting about how we could expand and go in-depth with the
                    new project, ending the session with some great ideas. The
                    expansion ideas were presented to the entire team at the
                    next formal meeting. Everyone chose the areas they would
                    like to write up. Michelle created the new group logo and
                    created some icons for our proposed rewards feature of the
                    application. Blayne, Jake and Michelle contributed most to
                    the structure of the project idea, working together to go
                    in-depth about features and adding in the other members
                    feature write-ups where they fit well.

                  <span>
                    Outside of the project idea, Helia and Burak volunteered to
                    attend the interview. Everyone agreed for them to be the
                    only ones as we did not want it to feel less like an
                    interview and more like a panel. Helia and Burak also chose
                    to write up on the interview and worked together to create a
                    well-structured flow to the report. Charlie, Blayne, Jake,
                    and Michelle each decided on the IT Technology they wanted
                    to report on and agreed upon a uniform structure. Initially,
                    Helia and Burak chose to work together on the Industry Data
                    section. However, towards the end, Michelle, Blayne, and
                    Jake contributed to it too by providing feedback and writing
                    some things themselves. As a team, we all discussed how the
                    team profile and ideal jobs sections should be structured,
                    preferring to go in-depth and ensure it was all uniform. As
                    Helia had personal reasons for not completing A1, Michelle
                    helped her finish it to ensure that all our contributions in
                    both A1 and A2 were even and displayed.

                  <br />
                  <span></span>
                  <br />
                  <span>
                    Most, if not all meeting records were done by Michelle,
                    Blayne, and sometimes Jake. Most citations were formatted
                    correctly by Charlie, Helia, Jake and Blayne. Blayne, Helia,
                    and Michelle polished the final two reports, while Jake,
                    Michelle, Charlie and Blayne polished the website. On a
                    final note, although some people did contribute in areas
                    that were not assigned to them, these were done willingly
                    because it has been engaging and pleasant to work alongside
                    each other.

                    Across the weeks of the assignment, formal meetings were
                    held twice a week, recorded for ~30 mins, however often
                    continued for up to 6 hours. This time was not forced, and
                    was used to collaborate in real time on joint portions of
                    the assignment, as well as to provide help and feedback to
                    other members of the group. Another 2-3 informal meetings
                    were held through the week with the same real time
                    collaboration, discussion and typically length.
                  </span>
                  <br />
                  <span>
                    As we worked on the assignment, there were points where
                    almost each team member had one on one collaboration,
                    spending a few hours working together to finish off sections
                    or offer help towards difficult parts. These sessions came
                    naturally and each team member was more than willing to help
                    out in this aspect. This helped our assignment and team work
                    tremendously and is an aspect we hope will continue into A3
                    as most of us got our best work done this way. As we came up
                    with questions that were best answered by tutors, we
                    assigned individual questions to group members, to give
                    opportunity for this to be a shared task, rather than an
                    individual feeling like it was an extra addition to their
                    workload.
                  </span>
                  <br />
                  <span>
                    As a group there have been no arguments or hiccups or
                    resentful feelings that have been brought to the table,
                    which has been a great relief for most of us and our history
                    with teamwork collaborations in the past. The only thing
                    that didn’t work well in our group was a couple people not
                    meeting deadlines due to real life happening, although no
                    one blames them of course. They still always showed up with
                    their work that was assigned, just a little later than what
                    the rest would have liked. Next time, to help fix this,
                    could be an option to discuss prior commitments and work
                    schedules more in depth to assign more appropriate sections,
                    especially if someone falls behind; instead of handing in
                    the full assigned section late, they could hand in what they
                    have done already for someone else to finish, and find
                    another area to work on when they have more time or assign
                    shorter, but better quality sections to those with less
                    available time.

                  <span>
                    In the middle of the assignment period, workload was
                    discussed and contribution percentages were predetermined,
                    up for future change. These were relatively similar, with
                    higher percentages reflective of workload and effort. In the
                    final week some of these values were changed to
                    appropriately reflect actual contributions of each team
                    member. In doing this it was clear that some group members
                    had performed a bit more on certain final aspects of the
                    assignment than others, with life getting in the way which
                    is understandable. We hope to keep this transparency in A3
                    as it immediately sets expectations of workload that can be
                    reflected on towards the final deadline. In the final days,
                    we had a hard but necessary talk where everyone anonymously
                    submitted the % contribution they thought they had done and
                    then we went through each answer and spoke about why it was
                    so low or high and came to an agreement on everyone’s %
                    contribution. The conversation definitely highlighted our
                    fortitude as a team and we are grateful that there have been
                    no bad experiences in any part of doing this assignment
                    together.

                      I have really enjoyed the team work aspect of this course
                      so far. Like many of us do, I didn’t like the idea of
                      working with others as I usually find I can be more
                      productive by working on my own. The main surprise I found
                      has been the pressure (nicest kind) behind me to work
                      better and harder has really helped change my view on
                      team-based tasks. Going into IT I knew that I’d have to
                      become a better team player, and I couldn’t be happier
                      with the space my teammates facilitated in getting there.
                      I believe our time management could have improved but this
                      was only based upon commitments outside of uni that are
                      almost always unavoidable. Perhaps a short message
                      explaining how you’re doing with your work every 2nd/3rd
                      day may be an idea for next time. I’ve learnt many things
                      during this process, a lot about myself and what I can
                      achieve, how to use teams and different websites related
                      to the project and also how to communicate a lot better.
                      Teams are built on communication and without it, people
                      veer away from the task and can leave the rest of the
                      group in shambles. Luckily for us we’ve had a smooth
                      journey so far. I’m always glad to make friends, even more
                      so to have those who are like minded in terms of career
                      industry. Couldn’t have asked for a better team.

                          Over the course of this assignment I have been
                          extraordinarily pleased with the overall effort from
                          the group. I understand that work and family
                          commitments come first, and that illness can get in
                          the way. I’m pleased with the outcome considering
                          these factors and happy that everyone worked
                          efficiently enough given some circumstances to still
                          put forward quality work.

                          Improvement could have been made with our time
                          management, as some group set deadlines were missed,
                          however eventually caught up on. A few scheduled
                          meetings were also missed, however I believe every
                          occurrence was due to other more important
                          commitments, as mentioned earlier. The group worked
                          well together and the group dynamic was positive all
                          round. Everyone accepted critiquing of work, and all
                          members assisted others where required. One surprising
                          thing I noticed was that there was absolutely no
                          instance of unfairness or dislike towards other
                          members. All members worked well together and I would
                          even go ahead to say that we became friends. I learnt
                          that group work is not the same as I remember from
                          school, and that group projects aren’t that scary when
                          structured well. I look forward to working on future
                          group projects with the same members.

                        Working within a team on a group project can fairly
                        easily go really well, but can just as easily go really
                        poorly as well. Personally, I have had both experiences
                        in the past, and approached this group assignment with a
                        lot of enthusiasm. This is the first time I have had to
                        join without knowing very much about the people that
                        would be in my group, and usually you get to meet and
                        spend some time with classmates before having to
                        assemble into groups. Online lectures and tutorials
                        didn’t really give that same opportunity. Despite that
                        challenge I found that our group was very quick to build
                        rapport from our very first meeting on Teams. We shared
                        ideas and got to know each other’s strengths and
                        interests, which helped tremendously when it came to
                        dividing up the work and each person’s contributions to
                        the project. What surprised me the most about the team
                        assignment was that despite being essentially a randomly
                        selected group of people, we all get along really well.
                        This has made studying online a much more enjoyable
                        experience. At times, coordinating everybody to complete
                        work to make sure we were on track has been a challenge.
                        Most of this has been due to personal responsibilities
                        and illness. Unfortunately I contracted Covid-19 at a
                        time when we had deadlines coming up for completing
                        various parts of the assignment. This sort of thing is
                        always hard to plan for, what I learned from this was to
                        always give yourself some leeway for the unexpected. But
                        I was very pleased to see that my teammates were very
                        supportive and understanding, and always willing to lend
                        a hand. Ultimately I believe we have all worked hard to
                        achieve this outcome, and it has been an excellent
                        overall experience in getting better at working
                        collaboratively.

                          Our group has been a pleasant surprise. I could not
                          have anticipated actually making good friends whilst
                          working on a stressful and time consuming assignment
                          together. We successfully completed all tasks to a
                          high standard, not always to our set deadlines,
                          however we did manage to catch up. Our meetings were
                          certainly overextended some nights after the
                          formalities were out of the way, but I feel as though
                          working collaboratively whilst on a call was strongly
                          beneficial to the assignment as we could bounce off
                          one another in an immediate fashion. As much as I put
                          in a strong effort in the beginning weeks, I found
                          myself falling behind in not only the assignment but
                          also the overall course as the weeks went on. One
                          thing I learnt from this is that I strongly need to
                          work on my time management skills, and develop a
                          stronger mental approach to deadlines which I
                          endeavour to work on by setting aside more time for
                          study and trying to limit distractions. Overall, I am
                          grateful to have been invited to work with a welcoming
                          and understanding group of people and look forward to
                          working with them further through this course.

                        Going into this course, I was hesitant about the group
                        assignment aspect, as I did not have good experience
                        with it during schooling. Either due to joining groups
                        that did not want to contribute or feeling left out and
                        chosen at the last minute. This is why I went out of my
                        way to contact most of our group members, and I also
                        made a post on the group enrollment that a couple
                        replied to. I am delighted with our group as I feel like
                        we mesh together really well. I have enjoyed the
                        collaboration with everyone. My favourite thing about
                        our group is that we all help each other and don&apos;t
                        care if we will be doing too much work. The only
                        negative about our team is failing to meet deadlines;
                        however, I feel that these have mostly been due to life
                        coming first. We have had a couple of people sick or
                        just too busy with their family or work. In our next
                        assignment we could add on daily check ins to help keep
                        each other motivated to sticking to deadlines. For me, a
                        surprising element of our group has been how close we
                        all are with each other in a short amount of time. We
                        consistently have group calls outside of our formal
                        meetings that go on for hours, where we collaborate in
                        real-time with each other and talk about our future
                        pathway with completing our Bachelor of IT and how nice
                        it is to have a group of people to go on this journey
                        with. The main thing I have learned about group work is
                        that when you are in a group with like-minded and
                        hard-working people, doing your assignments does not
                        feel like a chore or something to dread; instead, it
                        feels exciting to collaborate because it allows for a
                        friendly environment and I never feel like I&apos;m
                        alone with my work. I always thought that I would prefer
                        to work solo, so I&apos;m pleasantly surprised to see
                        how creative I can be when I have other people to bounce
                        ideas around. I&apos;m excited to see the mark our hard
                        work gets us.

                      I don’t think I have had a better experience working in a
                      group than this one. It has been such a pleasure to work
                      along like minded people and more importantly make new
                      friends. I think working on a project alongside people
                      that I enjoy spending time with has definitely improved my
                      motivation to study. I love how easy going everyone is and
                      we are not scared to put in more work and help each other
                      out when needed. The only downsides we have had so far is
                      meeting deadlines on time due to life getting in the way
                      which is understandable, but on the bright side everyone
                      caught on pretty quick. I think for next time it would be
                      good to do a daily check in on our progress and plans for
                      the day to stay on top of everything. Going into the
                      course I definitely felt very lost and worried about the
                      group project as I was not sure if I was able to stay on
                      top of my tasks and deliver the outcome I wanted but
                      surprisingly it has gone so much better than I expected.
                      Working with my amazing team mates has definitely changed
                      my outlook on studying. Now I always look forward to
                      opening up my laptop and getting work done and plus I’m
                      always very excited to catch up with everyone on video
                      calls. I think you can definitely tell that we enjoy
                      eachothers company as we spend 3+ hours on video call
                      talking about our assignments and personal life. Going
                      into this assignment one thing that has surprised me is
                      how I have been able to stay committed and deliver the
                      outcomes I wished for. My previous group work experience
                      have not been the best as people seem to get overly
                      competitive and politics getting in the way but the main
                      thing that has surprised me is how everyone in our team is
                      willing to put their hand up and offer their help without
                      feeling like they are doing extra work, we are all equal
                      and our main goal is to learn, help and get the project
                      done in the best way possible. Working on this group
                      assignment I learned a lot of things. I have learned the
                      people you work with have a huge impact on how you perform
                      and everyone’s attitude has made this experience much more
                      than pleasant. Honestly this is the best group and
                      deserves all of the recognition we can get as we have put
                      in the effort to deliver the best outcomes.
