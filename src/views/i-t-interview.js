            Our interviewee Mark Murray is a RIS PACS Administrator and a casual
            radiographer with the Murrumbidgee Local Health District and
            Southern NSW Local Health District. According to eHealth, NSW

            &quot;Radiology information systems and picture archiving and
            communication systems (RIS-PACS) are electronic solutions used by
            medical imaging departments to manage their services. They track a
            patient&apos;s journey from an image request through to diagnosis -
            storing key information, digital images and results for easy access
            by treating teams.&quot;

            Mark discovered his passion for IT very early on in his career as he
            spent his spare time building and working on computers at home. He
            started his career as a federally registered health professional and
            radiographer. His opportunity to make a career in IT came when
            medical imaging systems were making a transition from film to
            digital. This period brought on a lot of change and innovation. His
            organisation needed staff that could get involved in the testing
            process and conversion of film images to digital files on patient
            records systems.
            <span
              dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
                __html: ' ',

          <br></br>
          <span></span>
          <br></br>
          <span>
            The changes allowed Mark to transition into a role as RIS PACS
            Application Specialist and then onto his current role as RIS PACS
            Administrator. He was not required to have formal qualifications in
            IT but has completed many short courses on IT and aims to complete a
            short course on SQL to develop his skills further. Becoming a RIS
            PACS Administrator first required one to be a radiographer first, as
            the role required specialist domain knowledge in medical imaging to
            understand and resolve the issues that arise in this position.

            The role of a RIS PACS Administrator is to support the many systems
            that allow radiographers and radiologists to deliver medical imaging
            services to patients. The systems listed by Mark included the
            Patient Management Medical Records System, Imaging System, Patient
            Information Management System, and the Electronic Medical Records
            System. These systems are the backbone of all health services
            operated around the country.

            Mark&apos;s day to day activities varies depending on if there are
            any outages or project work required at the time. A large part of
            his time is taking calls and answering tickets received at the
            service desk. Many of the enquiries are related to error correction.
            An example of this type of enquiry would be if a radiographer has
            either taken an x-ray of the left side of a limb instead of the
            right side or if the x-ray image was mislabeled. Another example
            will be if the x-ray images have been stored under the incorrect
            patient file. Mark is often the point of contact to have these
            errors corrected within the RIS PAC System. Another essential part
            of his role is training radiographers in using the Radiology
            Information System (RIS). On an ad-hoc basis, he also is required to
            deal with system outages. However, this type of issue is often
            escalated to a state-wide IT Service Desk to be resolved by Server
            or Network specialists.

            Different interactions are a big part of Mark&apos;s role; as a PACS
            Administrator, his day-to-day interactions vary from working
            alongside System users, which are Radiologists, radiographers, and
            clinical staff; for different issues arising, he also interacts with
            server administrators and Network Administrators. He also interacts
            with patients via a patient portal where patients can have easier
            access to their X-RAYS. Mark mentioned that working in Health IT,
            there are different experts for different systems; he used an
            example that if a system error occurs where the system has failed to
            receive messages, this issue is allocated to the State-wide Service
            desk by raising a ticket.

            For some, being on call 24/7 might be a challenge, but as a PACS
            administrator, Mark&apos;s primary focus is patient care. Being in
            Health IT for about 30 years every day is not the same as Mark
            mentioned; every day is a different challenge. As a PACS
            administrator who covers the Murrumbidgee Local health district and
            Southern NSW, Mark finds system outages the most challenging as
            there is a high demand for X Rays from patients. He mentioned that
            the best way to approach these challenges is to be patient with
            people and understand their needs during these unexpected outages.
            Despite the challenges Mark faces every day, he is very passionate
            and appreciates his work.

            To be a PACS Administrator, you will need to hold a degree in
            radiologic technology or a field related to healthcare, such as
            healthcare administration. Mark mentioned it is best to have a
            strong interest in IT as there are different interacting systems
            that one needs to get familiar with within this role. His role
            connects to the medical field as it requires prior experience in the
            medical industry. He mentioned that you would have basic knowledge
            of how the systems work as a radiographer. However, as a PACS
            Administrator, your knowledge of the systems goes much deeper to
            maintain, manage and error control the systems. As a PACS
            Administrator, it is crucial to gain prior experience, preferably as
            a radiologist or radiographer.
            <span
              dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
                __html: ' ',
              }}

            Based on our research, there are many career paths to becoming a
            PACS administrator, but some essential skills are required for this
            role. One of the main requirements is holding a degree in a field
            related to healthcare, such as a bachelor&apos;s degree in medical
            imaging, radiography, or applied science. The other aspect of a PACS
            Administrator is the technical skills required to have deep
            knowledge of the industry, programs, and systems such as Health
            Level 7 (HL7), Digital imaging and communications (DICOM) in
            medicine. Mark also mentioned that it is beneficial to learn SQL
            because it is used in database systems. Besides the technical and
            medical skills required for this job, communication skills are a
            crucial point when dealing with patients, vendors, and providers, as
            they should be able to explain incredibly high technical
            information. This role requires a niche skillset and a broad number
            of challenges, but as Mark mentioned, it is one of the best roles he
            has been in, and he very much enjoys his current role.
