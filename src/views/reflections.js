                  Group member contributions were split evenly as much as
                  possible; however, we did not stick to this as a strict rule.
                  At some points, we willingly helped each other in small groups
                  working in Google Docs and doing real-time collaboration. We
                  allowed each member to choose parts that they would prefer to
                  work on, helping create a friendly and willing to contribute
                  environment. At first, our group logo was created as a team.
                  This is when we were going ahead with our original project
                  idea and named ourselves &apos;Game Up.&apos; However, Jake,
                  Blayne, and Michelle were up late and talked about our
                  team&apos;s overall lack of contribution to the project idea
                  at that stage, as the group had not yet spoken about how to
                  expand or even create a feasible project.

                    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{

                <span></span>
                <br></br>
                <span>
                  Jake, Blayne, and Michelle then came up with a &apos;proposal
                  of change&apos; to submit to the remaining members of the
                  team. This document was in-depth and spoke about both pros and
                  cons of changing the project idea. The team ended up agreeing
                  with the proposal. We swapped project ideas, had a lengthy
                  discussion about why we hadn&apos;t contributed to the old
                  project idea and concluded that while it was an excellent idea
                  and felt detailed already, not many of us knew how to expand
                  such a business project.
                  <span
                    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
                      __html: ' ',

                <span></span>
                <br></br>
                <span>
                  With the project idea changed and the announcement of an
                  extension, Blayne, Michelle, and Helia had an impromptu
                  meeting about how we could expand and go in-depth with the new
                  project, ending the session with some great ideas. The
                  expansion ideas were presented to the entire team at the next
                  formal meeting. Everyone chose the areas they would like to
                  write up. Michelle created the new group logo and created some
                  icons for our proposed rewards feature of the application.
                  Blayne, Jake and Michelle contributed most to the structure of
                  the project idea, working together to go in-depth about
                  features and adding in the other members feature write-ups
                  where they fit well.

                <span>
                  Outside of the project idea, Helia and Burak volunteered to
                  attend the interview. Everyone agreed for them to be the only
                  ones as we did not want it to feel less like an interview and
                  more like a panel. Helia and Burak also chose to write up on
                  the interview and worked together to create a well-structured
                  flow to the report. Charlie, Blayne, Jake, and Michelle each
                  decided on the IT Technology they wanted to report on and
                  agreed upon a uniform structure. Initially, Helia and Burak
                  chose to work together on the Industry Data section. However,
                  towards the end, Michelle, Blayne, and Jake contributed to it
                  too by providing feedback and writing some things themselves.
                  As a team, we all discussed how the team profile and ideal
                  jobs sections should be structured, preferring to go in-depth
                  and ensure it was all uniform. As Helia had personal reasons
                  for not completing A1, Michelle helped her finish it to ensure
                  that all our contributions in both A1 and A2 were even and
                  displayed.

                <span>
                  Most, if not all meeting records were done by Michelle,
                  Blayne, and sometimes Jake. Most citations were formatted
                  correctly by Charlie, Helia, Jake and Blayne. Blayne, Helia,
                  and Michelle polished the final two reports, while Jake,
                  Michelle, Charlie and Blayne polished the website. On a final
                  note, although some people did contribute in areas that were
                  not assigned to them, these were done willingly because it has
                  been engaging and pleasant to work alongside each other.

                  Across the weeks of the assignment, formal meetings were held
                  twice a week, recorded for ~30 mins, however often continued
                  for up to 6 hours. This time was not forced, and was used to
                  collaborate in real time on joint portions of the assignment,
                  as well as to provide help and feedback to other members of
                  the group. Another 2-3 informal meetings were held through the
                  week with the same real time collaboration, discussion and
                  typically length.

                <br></br>
                <span>
                  As we worked on the assignment, there were points where almost
                  each team member had one on one collaboration, spending a few
                  hours working together to finish off sections or offer help
                  towards difficult parts. These sessions came naturally and
                  each team member was more than willing to help out in this
                  aspect. This helped our assignment and team work tremendously
                  and is an aspect we hope will continue into A3 as most of us
                  got our best work done this way. As we came up with questions
                  that were best answered by tutors, we assigned individual
                  questions to group members, to give opportunity for this to be
                  a shared task, rather than an individual feeling like it was
                  an extra addition to their workload.
                </span>
                <br></br>
                <span>
                  As a group there have been no arguments or hiccups or
                  resentful feelings that have been brought to the table, which
                  has been a great relief for most of us and our history with
                  teamwork collaborations in the past. The only thing that
                  didnâ€™t work well in our group was a couple people not meeting
                  deadlines due to real life happening, although no one blames
                  them of course. They still always showed up with their work
                  that was assigned, just a little later than what the rest
                  would have liked. Next time, to help fix this, could be an
                  option to discuss prior commitments and work schedules more in
                  depth to assign more appropriate sections, especially if
                  someone falls behind; instead of handing in the full assigned
                  section late, they could hand in what they have done already
                  for someone else to finish, and find another area to work on
                  when they have more time or assign shorter, but better quality
                  sections to those with less available time.

                  In the middle of the assignment period, workload was discussed
                  and contribution percentages were predetermined, up for future
                  change. These were relatively similar, with higher percentages
                  reflective of workload and effort. In the final week some of
                  these values were changed to appropriately reflect actual
                  contributions of each team member. In doing this it was clear
                  that some group members had performed a bit more on certain
                  final aspects of the assignment than others, with life getting
                  in the way which is understandable. We hope to keep this
                  transparency in A3 as it immediately sets expectations of
                  workload that can be reflected on towards the final deadline.
                  In the final days, we had a hard but necessary talk where
                  everyone anonymously submitted the % contribution they thought
                  they had done and then we went through each answer and spoke
                  about why it was so low or high and came to an agreement on
                  everyoneâ€™s % contribution. The conversation definitely
                  highlighted our fortitude as a team and we are grateful that
                  there have been no bad experiences in any part of doing this
                  assignment together.

                    I have really enjoyed the team work aspect of this course so
                    far. Like many of us do, I didnâ€™t like the idea of working
                    with others as I usually find I can be more productive by
                    working on my own. The main surprise I found has been the
                    pressure (nicest kind) behind me to work better and harder
                    has really helped change my view on team-based tasks. Going
                    into IT I knew that Iâ€™d have to become a better team player,
                    and I couldnâ€™t be happier with the space my teammates
                    facilitated in getting there. I believe our time management
                    could have improved but this was only based upon commitments
                    outside of uni that are almost always unavoidable. Perhaps a
                    short message explaining how youâ€™re doing with your work
                    every 2nd/3rd day may be an idea for next time. Iâ€™ve learnt
                    many things during this process, a lot about myself and what
                    I can achieve, how to use teams and different websites
                    related to the project and also how to communicate a lot
                    better. Teams are built on communication and without it,
                    people veer away from the task and can leave the rest of the
                    group in shambles. Luckily for us weâ€™ve had a smooth journey
                    so far. Iâ€™m always glad to make friends, even more so to
                    have those who are like minded in terms of career industry.
                    Couldnâ€™t have asked for a better team.

                        Over the course of this assignment I have been
                        extraordinarily pleased with the overall effort from the
                        group. I understand that work and family commitments
                        come first, and that illness can get in the way. Iâ€™m
                        pleased with the outcome considering these factors and
                        happy that everyone worked efficiently enough given some
                        circumstances to still put forward quality work.

                        Improvement could have been made with our time
                        management, as some group set deadlines were missed,
                        however eventually caught up on. A few scheduled
                        meetings were also missed, however I believe every
                        occurrence was due to other more important commitments,
                        as mentioned earlier. The group worked well together and
                        the group dynamic was positive all round. Everyone
                        accepted critiquing of work, and all members assisted
                        others where required. One surprising thing I noticed
                        was that there was absolutely no instance of unfairness
                        or dislike towards other members. All members worked
                        well together and I would even go ahead to say that we
                        became friends. I learnt that group work is not the same
                        as I remember from school, and that group projects
                        arenâ€™t that scary when structured well. I look forward
                        to working on future group projects with the same
                        members.

                      Working within a team on a group project can fairly easily
                      go really well, but can just as easily go really poorly as
                      well. Personally, I have had both experiences in the past,
                      and approached this group assignment with a lot of
                      enthusiasm. This is the first time I have had to join
                      without knowing very much about the people that would be
                      in my group, and usually you get to meet and spend some
                      time with classmates before having to assemble into
                      groups. Online lectures and tutorials didnâ€™t really give
                      that same opportunity. Despite that challenge I found that
                      our group was very quick to build rapport from our very
                      first meeting on Teams. We shared ideas and got to know
                      each otherâ€™s strengths and interests, which helped
                      tremendously when it came to dividing up the work and each
                      personâ€™s contributions to the project. What surprised me
                      the most about the team assignment was that despite being
                      essentially a randomly selected group of people, we all
                      get along really well. This has made studying online a
                      much more enjoyable experience. At times, coordinating
                      everybody to complete work to make sure we were on track
                      has been a challenge. Most of this has been due to
                      personal responsibilities and illness. Unfortunately I
                      contracted Covid-19 at a time when we had deadlines coming
                      up for completing various parts of the assignment. This
                      sort of thing is always hard to plan for, what I learned
                      from this was to always give yourself some leeway for the
                      unexpected. But I was very pleased to see that my
                      teammates were very supportive and understanding, and
                      always willing to lend a hand. Ultimately I believe we
                      have all worked hard to achieve this outcome, and it has
                      been an excellent overall experience in getting better at
                      working collaboratively.

                        Our group has been a pleasant surprise. I could not have
                        anticipated actually making good friends whilst working
                        on a stressful and time consuming assignment together.
                        We successfully completed all tasks to a high standard,
                        not always to our set deadlines, however we did manage
                        to catch up. Our meetings were certainly overextended
                        some nights after the formalities were out of the way,
                        but I feel as though working collaboratively whilst on a
                        call was strongly beneficial to the assignment as we
                        could bounce off one another in an immediate fashion. As
                        much as I put in a strong effort in the beginning weeks,
                        I found myself falling behind in not only the assignment
                        but also the overall course as the weeks went on. One
                        thing I learnt from this is that I strongly need to work
                        on my time management skills, and develop a stronger
                        mental approach to deadlines which I endeavour to work
                        on by setting aside more time for study and trying to
                        limit distractions. Overall, I am grateful to have been
                        invited to work with a welcoming and understanding group
                        of people and look forward to working with them further
                        through this course.

                      Going into this course, I was hesitant about the group
                      assignment aspect, as I did not have good experience with
                      it during schooling. Either due to joining groups that did
                      not want to contribute or feeling left out and chosen at
                      the last minute. This is why I went out of my way to
                      contact most of our group members, and I also made a post
                      on the group enrollment that a couple replied to. I am
                      delighted with our group as I feel like we mesh together
                      really well. I have enjoyed the collaboration with
                      everyone. My favourite thing about our group is that we
                      all help each other and don&apos;t care if we will be
                      doing too much work. The only negative about our team is
                      failing to meet deadlines; however, I feel that these have
                      mostly been due to life coming first. We have had a couple
                      of people sick or just too busy with their family or work.
                      In our next assignment we could add on daily check ins to
                      help keep each other motivated to sticking to deadlines.
                      For me, a surprising element of our group has been how
                      close we all are with each other in a short amount of
                      time. We consistently have group calls outside of our
                      formal meetings that go on for hours, where we collaborate
                      in real-time with each other and talk about our future
                      pathway with completing our Bachelor of IT and how nice it
                      is to have a group of people to go on this journey with.
                      The main thing I have learned about group work is that
                      when you are in a group with like-minded and hard-working
                      people, doing your assignments does not feel like a chore
                      or something to dread; instead, it feels exciting to
                      collaborate because it allows for a friendly environment
                      and I never feel like I&apos;m alone with my work. I
                      always thought that I would prefer to work solo, so
                      I&apos;m pleasantly surprised to see how creative I can be
                      when I have other people to bounce ideas around. I&apos;m
                      excited to see the mark our hard work gets us.

                    I donâ€™t think I have had a better experience working in a
                    group than this one. It has been such a pleasure to work
                    along like minded people and more importantly make new
                    friends. I think working on a project alongside people that
                    I enjoy spending time with has definitely improved my
                    motivation to study. I love how easy going everyone is and
                    we are not scared to put in more work and help each other
                    out when needed. The only downsides we have had so far is
                    meeting deadlines on time due to life getting in the way
                    which is understandable, but on the bright side everyone
                    caught on pretty quick. I think for next time it would be
                    good to do a daily check in on our progress and plans for
                    the day to stay on top of everything. Going into the course
                    I definitely felt very lost and worried about the group
                    project as I was not sure if I was able to stay on top of my
                    tasks and deliver the outcome I wanted but surprisingly it
                    has gone so much better than I expected. Working with my
                    amazing team mates has definitely changed my outlook on
                    studying. Now I always look forward to opening up my laptop
                    and getting work done and plus Iâ€™m always very excited to
                    catch up with everyone on video calls. I think you can
                    definitely tell that we enjoy eachothers company as we spend
                    3+ hours on video call talking about our assignments and
                    personal life. Going into this assignment one thing that has
                    surprised me is how I have been able to stay committed and
                    deliver the outcomes I wished for. My previous group work
                    experience have not been the best as people seem to get
                    overly competitive and politics getting in the way but the
                    main thing that has surprised me is how everyone in our team
                    is willing to put their hand up and offer their help without
                    feeling like they are doing extra work, we are all equal and
                    our main goal is to learn, help and get the project done in
                    the best way possible. Working on this group assignment I
                    learned a lot of things. I have learned the people you work
                    with have a huge impact on how you perform and everyoneâ€™s
                    attitude has made this experience much more than pleasant.
                    Honestly this is the best group and deserves all of the
                    recognition we can get as we have put in the effort to
                    deliver the best outcomes.
