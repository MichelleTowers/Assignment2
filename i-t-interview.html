              This report covers what it is like working as a PACS Administrator
              and gaining a deeper view of Mark&apos;s early career life, his
              motivation for exploring technology, and his career path to
              becoming a PACS administrator. We had a more in-depth conversation
              regarding the health IT industry. We discussed other
              industry-related topics such as different interactions, day-to-day
              tasks, systems, challenges, and what he enjoys the most about his
              job. Based on our interview with Mark, we have gone more in-depth
              and researched different career paths, Medical and technical
              required skills individuals could take to become a PACS
              administrator.

              Our interviewee Mark Murray is a RIS PACS Administrator and a
              casual radiographer with the Murrumbidgee Local Health District
              and Southern NSW Local Health District. According to eHealth, NSW
              Government

            <span>
              &quot;Radiology information systems and picture archiving and
              communication systems (RIS-PACS) are electronic solutions used by
              medical imaging departments to manage their services. They track a
              patient&apos;s journey from an image request through to diagnosis
              - storing key information, digital images and results for easy
              access by treating teams.&quot;

              Mark discovered his passion for IT very early on in his career as
              he spent his spare time building and working on computers at home.
              He started his career as a federally registered health
              professional and radiographer. His opportunity to make a career in
              IT came when medical imaging systems were making a transition from
              film to digital. This period brought on a lot of change and
              innovation. His organisation needed staff that could get involved
              in the testing process and conversion of film images to digital
              files on patient records systems.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              The changes allowed Mark to transition into a role as RIS PACS
              Application Specialist and then onto his current role as RIS PACS
              Administrator. He was not required to have formal qualifications
              in IT but has completed many short courses on IT and aims to
              complete a short course on SQL to develop his skills further.
              Becoming a RIS PACS Administrator first required one to be a
              radiographer first, as the role required specialist domain
              knowledge in medical imaging to understand and resolve the issues
              that arise in this position.

            <br />
            <span>
              The role of a RIS PACS Administrator is to support the many
              systems that allow radiographers and radiologists to deliver
              medical imaging services to patients. The systems listed by Mark
              included the Patient Management Medical Records System, Imaging
              System, Patient Information Management System, and the Electronic
              Medical Records System. These systems are the backbone of all
              health services operated around the country.

            <span>
              Mark&apos;s day to day activities varies depending on if there are
              any outages or project work required at the time. A large part of
              his time is taking calls and answering tickets received at the
              service desk. Many of the enquiries are related to error
              correction. An example of this type of enquiry would be if a
              radiographer has either taken an x-ray of the left side of a limb
              instead of the right side or if the x-ray image was mislabeled.
              Another example will be if the x-ray images have been stored under
              the incorrect patient file. Mark is often the point of contact to
              have these errors corrected within the RIS PAC System. Another
              essential part of his role is training radiographers in using the
              Radiology Information System (RIS). On an ad-hoc basis, he also is
              required to deal with system outages. However, this type of issue
              is often escalated to a state-wide IT Service Desk to be resolved
              by Server or Network specialists.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span></span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Different interactions are a big part of Mark&apos;s role; as a
              PACS Administrator, his day-to-day interactions vary from working
              alongside System users, which are Radiologists, radiographers, and
              clinical staff; for different issues arising, he also interacts
              with server administrators and Network Administrators. He also
              interacts with patients via a patient portal where patients can
              have easier access to their X-RAYS. Mark mentioned that working in
              Health IT, there are different experts for different systems; he
              used an example that if a system error occurs where the system has
              failed to receive messages, this issue is allocated to the
              State-wide Service desk by raising a ticket.

              For some, being on call 24/7 might be a challenge, but as a PACS
              administrator, Mark&apos;s primary focus is patient care. Being in
              Health IT for about 30 years every day is not the same as Mark
              mentioned; every day is a different challenge. As a PACS
              administrator who covers the Murrumbidgee Local health district
              and Southern NSW, Mark finds system outages the most challenging
              as there is a high demand for X Rays from patients. He mentioned
              that the best way to approach these challenges is to be patient
              with people and understand their needs during these unexpected
              outages. Despite the challenges Mark faces every day, he is very
              passionate and appreciates his work.

              To be a PACS Administrator, you will need to hold a degree in
              radiologic technology or a field related to healthcare, such as
              healthcare administration. Mark mentioned it is best to have a
              strong interest in IT as there are different interacting systems
              that one needs to get familiar with within this role. His role
              connects to the medical field as it requires prior experience in
              the medical industry. He mentioned that you would have basic
              knowledge of how the systems work as a radiographer. However, as a
              PACS Administrator, your knowledge of the systems goes much deeper
              to maintain, manage and error control the systems. As a PACS
              Administrator, it is crucial to gain prior experience, preferably
              as a radiologist or radiographer.

            <span>
              Based on our research, there are many career paths to becoming a
              PACS administrator, but some essential skills are required for
              this role. One of the main requirements is holding a degree in a
              field related to healthcare, such as a bachelor&apos;s degree in
              medical imaging, radiography, or applied science. The other aspect
              of a PACS Administrator is the technical skills required to have
              deep knowledge of the industry, programs, and systems such as
              Health Level 7 (HL7), Digital imaging and communications (DICOM)
              in medicine. Mark also mentioned that it is beneficial to learn
              SQL because it is used in database systems. Besides the technical
              and medical skills required for this job, communication skills are
              a crucial point when dealing with patients, vendors, and
              providers, as they should be able to explain incredibly high
              technical information. This role requires a niche skillset and a
              broad number of challenges, but as Mark mentioned, it is one of
              the best roles he has been in, and he very much enjoys his current
              role.
