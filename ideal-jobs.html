              The table above demonstrates the key knowledge and career plan
              differences in our ideal jobs. As our ideal jobs are all in
              different spectrums of the IT industry, we are going to discuss
              the key differences between all aspects of the job as well.

              As we obtain our ideal job, our differences between jobs will
              differ in many ways, including our responsibilities, interactions
              with other co-workers, salaries and certifications needed for
              future potential growth. Below is an in-depth explanation of the
              differences of each of our ideal jobs, responsibilities, the
              specific career pathways and our salary ranges. We chose to not
              touch on skills here because we went in-depth on skill differences
              and similarities in Industry Data.

              A Database Administrator will have constant meetings with various
              teams within the company to ensure the best way to design
              databases and business logic for each team. They are responsible
              for corruption checking and solving throughout the company and
              will provide critical technical advice, contributing to developing
              and implementing new and existing systems, designing preventative
              measures, and maintaining backups. The average salary of a
              Database Administrator in Australia is $100,327, with the
              potential for growth by obtaining cloud certifications and
              experience, which could also assist them in stepping into a
              Database developer role and increase their salary by $10,000. On
              average, earning $100k will place them in the &apos;upper-middle
              class&apos; based on the Australian standard salary market.

              A Service Desk Analyst consists of three tiers, each holding its
              own responsibilities. A level 1 will be providing internal and
              external customer support. They typically manage simple hardware,
              software or network issues. If they cannot address the problem on
              their own, they will refer it to level 2. Level 2 is responsible
              for all new and existing IT support issues that have been
              escalated. They are also responsible for managing level 1
              technicians, providing support in the maintenance of IT networks
              and systems, and handling the company&apos;s ticketing systems.
              When confronted with a problem they cannot solve, they can
              escalate it to Level 3. Level 3 is the first point of contact with
              stakeholders for troubleshooting issues, typically in urgent
              matters. They resolve the most complex issues and identify trends
              in issue reporting to develop preventative solutions. The average
              salary of a Service Desk Analyst is $73,875, with the potential
              for growth by obtaining A+, Network+ and Server+ certifications
              which will assist them in stepping to a Systems Administrator role
              and increase their salary by $21,000. On average, earning under
              $100k will place them in the &apos;middle class&apos; based on the
              Australian standard salary market.

              a Penetration tester starts at $91,713, potentially increasing up
              to $134,638 with more experience. Their potential growth can be

              increasing their knowledge and experience with various risk
              assessment tools and methods, which will assist them in stepping
              into a Cyber Security Engineer role and increase their salary by
              $40,000. On average, earning well over $100k will place them in

                        My ideal job was as a Test Analyst. Having looked at the
                        Burning Glass data, my interest in analysis to find
                        imperfections still stands, however, my ideal job has
                        changed not due to the data itself, but rather personal
                        research on machine learning and artificial
                        intelligence. Diverting my career path interest toward
                        AI leads to the development of skills that are broadly
                        applicable to many fields of IT, including test
                        analysis. Therefore my ideal job is in the field of AI
                        development. As we keep moving into the future, AI is
                        becoming more prevalent, in interactable smartphone
                        applications and industries because it’s more efficient
                        when performed by an algorithm rather than a human
                        thought process. The idea of a future of self-driving
                        cars and assistant robots is fascinating to me, and we
                        are already on the verge of this being a reality with
                        huge leaps in this technology. I have much to learn and
                        many skills to develop to achieve this goal, as well as
                        consideration of AI minor subjects in my Bachelor of
                        Information Technology.

                      My ideal job is that of Full Stack Developer. After having
                      analysed the Burning Glass data this has only confirmed my
                      desire to focus my efforts on going down this career path.
                      The desire to become a full stack developer is one of the
                      factors that influenced me to study a Bachelor of IT. The
                      role encompasses a broad range of responsibilities and
                      will provide variety and interesting tasks; and most
                      importantly the role is responsible for understanding and
                      solving business problems with using code, as well as
                      stakeholder engagement, which ties in very nicely with my
                      previous career experience and qualifications. I aim to
                      develop the required skills to become a full stack
                      developer through completing programming and software
                      development subjects in the Bachelor of IT, building a
                      portfolio of relevant software projects and apps in
                      GitHub, and to begin preparing for common software
                      development interview questions.

                    My ideal job is a Computer Workshop Technician. Having
                    looked at the Burning Glass data, my ideal job hasn’t
                    changed. I’ve always been interested in this area, and
                    seeing the future outcomes for this line of work solidifies
                    this. I have a lot of experience with customer service,
                    which will help me move up and into a career like this. The
                    skills I’m currently lacking include Computer systems,
                    programming, and data-centred skills. My plan to complete a
                    Bachelor of Information Technology will tick off those
                    remaining skills needed and potentially a degree in business
                    management if I were to want a business of my own. I’ve
                    already got my foot in the door, but it may take a few years
                    to become fully qualified.

                    My ideal job is the Cyber Threat Hunter opportunity at the
                    department of home affairs. Having looked at the burning
                    glass data, my ideal job has not changed as this job is
                    fascinating to me because I have always been interested in
                    IT and law enforcement so to combine the two things, I’m
                    most passionate about sounds very appealing to me. This job
                    requires a high level of attention and working with a broad
                    number of different technologies. Also according to my own
                    research, Australia is suffering from a cyber security
                    skills shortage. This shortage provides a unique opportunity
                    for cyber security students and demand for their skills and
                    services will grow by at least 21% by May 2023(Labour Market
                    Insights, n.d) which confirms a promising future for a
                    career in Cyber Security. To be able to qualify for this job
                    I will need to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology
                    and also complete a Masters degree in Cyber Security.
