                          I&apos;m 26 years old and I&apos;m from central NSW in
                          Wagga Wagga. I completed my senior years of high
                          school in 2013 and took part in a Bachelor of Medical
                          Radiation Science; however, unfortunately, I decided
                          not to continue due to personal circumstances. My
                          career has been in management at Coles, and now I have
                          decided to pursue a new career path by studying IT
                          through RMIT. Interests outside of my professional
                          life include snowboarding in the winter and racing
                          superbikes in the summer. My interests also include
                          tuning and modifying high-powered vehicles, observing
                          stars and space, and building and experimenting with
                          computers, software, and various technologies. So far,
                          my IT experience in life has been the inclusivity and
                          teaching from my father in my childhood. I am
                          interested in the backend field of IT and how
                          computers work at their core.

                          I’m 37 years old and live in Sydney. I have obtained
                          experience in Finance &amp; Investments and corporate
                          sales throughout my career, and I have worked in
                          several technology startups in various capacities. I’m
                          fluent in English and Turkish and was born and raised
                          in Sydney, where I currently reside. I have had the
                          pleasure of working in London and have travelled to
                          dozens of locations worldwide. I have a keen interest
                          in fitness, enjoy training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and
                          have recently completed a marathon. My passion for IT
                          began at the ripe age of about six years old when I
                          first discovered computer games and was forced to
                          learn my way around MS-DOS and the command line so
                          that I could install and play my favourite games on my
                          home PC. Since then, much of my time has been spent
                          playing with computers through the early periods of
                          the internet entering homes, the invention of online
                          chat and social media, the evolution of gaming
                          consoles, and the introduction of smartphones.

                          I’m a 28-year-old rural kid that moved to the big city
                          (Melbourne) about 6-7 years ago. I finished year 11 in
                          high school (much regret) and haven’t studied since
                          then (going on 11 years now). I was raised in the
                          country, not surrounded by technology but what I did
                          have, definitely sucked me in. I’ve been an avid gamer
                          since I was a child; I was raised on a PlayStation 1,
                          and since then, I’ve levelled up and scored myself a
                          switch and am finally in the world of Zelda and Mario
                          games. Using consoles and computers has been a regular
                          thing for me and still is today. My experience is
                          limited, but I&apos;ve gotten into figuring out how
                          things work with the ‘tools’ I had/have. My experience
                          at work didn’t surround many IT-related things,
                          although I have learned how to use certain systems and
                          applications to get jobs done.

                          I’m 21 years old, and I live in Sydney. I moved to
                          Australia when I was 14 from Iran and am very grateful
                          to have created a new life in Australia. One of my
                          favourite things to do is working out and feeling
                          strong! The gym is my favourite place as I can take my
                          mind off things and focus on myself. I also like to
                          paint now and then, even though I might not be the
                          best painter. My main interest in IT comes from my
                          mother. She has her Masters in IT, and ever since I
                          was little, new Technology has always surrounded me.
                          When she was learning how to code, I would just sit
                          behind and be so fascinated by how everything works
                          behind the scenes. IT is such a male-dominated field,
                          so it’s very encouraging to see strong women in this
                          field! I’m also an IT recruiter, so to be able to
                          understand what I’m going to recruit for is a benefit.

                          I am 25 years of age and currently live in Toowoomba,
                          QLD. I have completed Year 12 and hold a Certificate
                          III in Media. My interests in IT vary in all corners
                          of the field. Growing up in the early 2000’s parallel
                          to the technological boom, has just been second nature
                          to me. I have not known anything entirely different
                          and have always kept up to date with the latest
                          trends. From an early age, disassembling machines and
                          figuring out how to put them back together has
                          directed my interest in learning how things work and
                          how they were created. This proceeded into wanting to
                          learn more and more, not just about hardware, but the
                          software and the impact IT has on the world. Most of
                          my IT experience is self-taught – spending hours on
                          end tinkering, watching YouTube, or browsing through
                          forums which I would also consider to be some of my
                          hobbies.

                          I’m 28 years old, and I live in Bendigo. My high
                          school days are nothing to reflect on, as I struggled
                          with mental health and did not apply myself well. I
                          regret this, and I am trying hard to start over with
                          what I want to do with my life. My hobbies include
                          video games, reading, and drawing. My favourite game
                          is Destiny 2. I’ve spent many hours playing it and
                          have met some amazing people. My interest in IT comes
                          from my grandfather, who not only gifted me my first
                          computer but taught me as much as I was willing to
                          learn about computers. I’m very thankful for this. My
                          experience comes from self-taught things, such as
                          learning to code and learning how to build my
                          computer. I only have one previous work experience,
                          which was volunteering. I was transferring paper data
                          to be digital. It was enjoyable and sparked my
                          interest in data administration due to needing to
                          focus and utilise logical thinking.
